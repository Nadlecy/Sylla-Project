# Sylla-Project

## Hi im creating what I call the sylla project

this project is rage-induced, self-hatred-fueled and only exists to make me suffer  
the concept is simple: i make some very common and normal data structures, jumble them together and create a fucking abomination  
maybe i will even use it for something,,,  
probably not,,,  
but hey at least the experience is there, the technical interest is also there,  
but there is also one more thing that is *really **really*** there, not sure what it is but it's certainly not a meaning of any sort or form  

## What the fuck is in this repo.

tis a bunch of **PYTHON** codes jumbled together  
i split the different data structures in case anyone wants to use em if they are too lazy to write literally less than 30 lines  
pretty sure the structures this bad boy contains right now are  
  
- stack  
- queue  
- (more to come)
  
but you can read the filenames, you dont need me to tell you everything
