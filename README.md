# Sylla-Project
## Hi im creating what I call the sylla project

this project is rage-induced, self-hatred-fueled and only exists to make me suffer  
the concept is simple: i make some very common and normal data structures, jumble them together and create a fucking abomination  
maybe i will even use it for something,,,  
probably not,,,  
but hey at least the experience is there, the technical interest is also there,  
but there is also one more thing that is *really **really*** there, not sure what it is but it's certainly not a meaning of any sort or form
